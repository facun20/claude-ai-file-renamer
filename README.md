# Claude File Renamer 📁✨

A powerful file renaming tool that uses Claude AI to intelligently analyze file content and suggest organized naming structures. This GUI application helps maintain consistent file naming conventions across teams and projects.


## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to understand file content and suggest appropriate names
- **Content Extraction**: Reads text from Word documents, PDFs, and analyzes filenames for other file types
- **Smart Fallback**: Works even when AI analysis is unavailable
- **File Collision Prevention**: Handles naming collisions automatically
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Select files to rename with easy checkboxes
- **Detailed Logs**: See exactly what's happening during the process

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- An Anthropic API key (for Claude)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-file-renamer.git
   cd claude-file-renamer
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python claude_renamer_gui.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Enter your Claude API key**
   - Sign up at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com) if you don't already have an account
   - Generate an API key in your Anthropic Console
   - Paste the key into the API Key field (it will be masked for security)

2. **Select a directory**
   - Click "Browse" to select the folder containing files you want to rename
   - Click "Scan Directory" to find supported files (.docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .jpg, etc.)

3. **Analyze Files**
   - Click "Analyze Files" to process the files with Claude AI
   - Each file will be analyzed to determine appropriate naming elements
   - Hover over suggested names to see Claude's reasoning

4. **Rename Files**
   - Select/deselect files using the checkboxes 
   - Click "Rename Selected Files" to apply the changes
   - Confirm when prompted

## Naming Convention

The tool follows a standard naming convention for files:

```
Subject_Description_DocumentForm_YYYYMMDD_Rev#.extension
```

Where:
- **Subject**: The main topic/department (e.g., "Finance")
- **Description**: What the document is about, in CamelCase (e.g., "QuarterlyReport")
- **DocumentForm**: A three-letter code indicating document type (e.g., "RPT" for Report)
- **Date**: Format YYYYMMDD (e.g., "20240515")
- **Revision**: Version status (e.g., "Rev0" for final, "RevA" for draft)

### Document Form Codes

Common document form codes include:
- **RPT**: Report
- **MEM**: Memo
- **FRM**: Form
- **MKT**: Marketing
- **IMG**: Image
- **DAT**: Data
- **DOC**: Document
- **PRO**: Proposal
- **GUI**: Guidelines

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is never stored and only used for the current session
- Files are processed locally on your computer
- Only file content is sent to Claude for analysis (no metadata)
- Claude's analysis is performed through secure API calls

## Customization

You can customize the document form codes by modifying the `DOCUMENT_FORMS` dictionary at the top of the script:

```python
DOCUMENT_FORMS = {
    "RPT": "Report",
    "MEM": "Memo",
    # Add your custom codes here
}
```
## Cost Considerations

Using Claude's API to analyze files incurs charges based on the number of tokens processed. Here's what you can expect:

### Real-World Example
- **1,600 files analyzed and renamed**: Approximately $7.64 total cost
- **Average cost per file**: Less than $0.005 (half a cent per file)

### Cost Factors
- **File size and complexity**: Larger documents require more tokens to analyze
- **File type**: Text-based files (like Word, PDF) cost more than image files since more content is analyzed
- **Model used**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers a good balance of quality and cost

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Use selective processing**: Only analyze files that truly need renaming
2. **Batch process files**: Run the tool during off-hours on batches of files
3. **Limit content analysis**: The tool extracts at most 4,000 characters from each file
4. **Use incognito mode for sensitive data**: Process sensitive files with local fallback naming when appropriate

### Claude API Pricing
Current Claude API pricing (as of May 2025) for Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
- **Input tokens**: $3.00 per million tokens
- **Output tokens**: $15.00 per million tokens
